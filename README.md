H. Nkiama, S. Zainudeen, and M. Saidu, “A Subset Feature Elimination Mechanism for Intrusion Detection System,” *International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications*, vol. 7, Apr. 2016, doi: <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070419">10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070419</a>

## Dataset
The publicaly available <a href="https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html">NSL-KDD Dataset</a> has been used.

## Implementation
Binary classification has been performed on each of the four attack categories. Results have been found to be consistent with the ones published in paper.
